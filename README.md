<h1 align="center">Keylogger Application using Python</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Keylogger program is a Python script that captures and logs keystrokes from the keyboard. It is designed for educational purposes only, such as cybersecurity courses, with proper authorization. This program demonstrates the basic functionality of a keylogger and uses the `pynput` library for cross-platform support.<br><br>
<b>Disclaimer:</b> Using keyloggers without explicit consent is illegal and unethical. Respect privacy and adhere to applicable laws and regulations. The author do not take any responsibility for the misuse of this program or any consequences arising from its usage.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

  - Python 3.x
  - pynput library

<h2>Installation</h2>

  - Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
  - Install the pynput library by running the following command: `pip install pynput`

<h2>Usage</h2>

  - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the keylogger program file is located.
  - Run the program using the following command: ```python keylogger.py```
  - The keylogger program will start running and capture keystrokes from the keyboard.
  - Press the `esc` key to stop the keylogger program. Once stopped, the program will exit, and the captured keystrokes will be stored in a file named `keylog.txt` in the same directory as the script.
  - Open the `keylog.txt` file to view the logged keystrokes.

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

- If you encounter any issues or errors while running the program, ensure that you have the required dependencies installed correctly.
- Make sure you have the necessary permissions to read and write files in the directory where the program is located.

<h2>Limitations</h2>

- The provided keylogger program is a basic example and may not capture certain keystrokes or handle complex scenarios.
- Depending on the operating system and user privileges, the keylogger may require administrative or elevated permissions to access keyboard input.
